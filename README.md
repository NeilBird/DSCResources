MicrosoftScriptCenter
----

Microsoft PowerShell Team publish awesome DSC Resource in ScriptCenter. (future PowerShellGet).

This include PSDesiredStateConfiguration Resource to create Pull Server.

This Repogitry keeps to some version and rename Resource Prefix from x to c as PowerShell Team recommended.


PowerShellOrgDSC
----

PowerShellOrg is community DSC Repository. Hope we can share Resources.

This include PowerShellOrg Resource which needed.

However some resource are too norty to use in production. (Like TaskScheduler / Choco Resource)  GraniResource include much more powerfull resource which already fully use in production for hundreds of Windows Server 2012 R2.
